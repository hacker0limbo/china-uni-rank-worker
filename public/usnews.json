Around 1.5 percent of the student body hails from abroad. Many of the university's international students receive financial support from one of three sources: the USTC Scholarship, the Chinese Government Scholarship or a fellowship that the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences offers. All three types of aid cover tuition and provide a stipend for other education-related costs. University housing is available for both undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nUSTC has more than a dozen schools, many of which are devoted to the sciences, but the university also has academic divisions focused on subjects such as public affairs and business. Additionally, the USTC School of the Gifted Young offers instruction for advanced students. The university follows a semester-based academic calendar. The primary language of instruction is Chinese, though some master’s and most doctoral programs are also offered in English. More than 70 percent of undergraduate students participate in USTC’s Research Program for Undergraduates, which takes place at university labs and Chinese Academy of Sciences research institutes. Among the research labs that USTC operates are the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale and the State Key Laboratory of Fire Science."

The institution is Taiwan's flagship university, and its main campus is located in Taipei, the capital city. The university also has facilities in Yilan, Hsinchu, Yunlin and other areas in central Taiwan. In a recent year, upward of 31,000 students attended the university.

Some university- and government-funded scholarships are available for foreign students, as is student housing.\n\nThe university has 11 colleges: bioresources and agriculture, electrical engineering and computer science, engineering, law, liberal arts, life science, management, medicine, public health, social sciences and science. The institution's academic calendar is semester-based, and the primary language of instruction is Mandarin, although a number of English-taught courses are available.
